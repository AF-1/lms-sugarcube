SugarCube Overview

This is kinda random stuff lol

Starting Off
+==========+
sub kickoff			# Fire on track change and timer expires

$track = Slim::Utils::Misc::pathFromFileURL($song);
my $untouchedtrack = $track;

$track = Plugins::SugarCube::Plugin::dirtyencoder($track);		// encode track
Plugins::SugarCube::Breakout::TrackTracker( $client, $track );	// save track

Check if Dynamic Queuing enabled
If we dont need a track exit (return)
Set sugarcube_working to 1
Set sugarcube_stats_mip_size to "A"

Check SugarCube Mode (sugarcube_mode)
If Standard MusicIP Mode (default failback if no prefs set)
BuildMIPReq( $client, $untouchedtrack );
SendtoMIPAsync( $client, $mypageurl );
} else {
FreeStyle( $client ); 		# FreeStyle Mode
}

Standard MusicIP Mode
+===================+
Build URL
Dynamic Path Conversion if required to
Otherwise just encode
Determine whether filter/genre/artist etc
Return the URL

SendtoMIPAsync 					# SendtoMIPAsync
If not response go to
gotErrorViaHTTP
else go to
gotMIP


gotMIP 					# gotMIP
Dynamic Path Conversion if required back
CHECK WHETHER ASYNC WAS FROM ALARM or AUTOMIX - IF SO THEN DONT SAVE CURRENT TRACK
See if "show statistics" is enabled
Get the playing file
Encode and then save the Current Playing Track details into the database (Save current Album, Save current Artist)
Pull details from db - if statistics pull extra fields
tracks.url, tracks.title, albums.title, genres.name, contributors.name, tracks_persistent.playCount, tracks_persistent.rating, tracks_persistent.lastPlayed, tracks.coverid, tracks.album, tracks.id

Save details into database
Drop following (DropEmPunk)
XMas tracks
# Block Artist we dont want
# Block Genres we dont want
Dropping as per statistics Block metrics


Note; Dupper code (try and guess if the queuing track was the same as the playing track ie. greatest hits or same but different directory) was never tested strong enough to release
